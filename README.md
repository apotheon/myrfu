# Myr-Fu

This project is a catch-all "Myrddin practice" repository.  I'm basically
grinding for levels by killing scorpids in Durotar.

I'll just apologize now for that awful analogy.

## Myrddin

Myrddin is "Merlin" in the original Welsh, before a French author mangled the
name to avoid introducing his readers to a word that sounded too much like the
French word for "shit".

[Myrddin][myr] is a (currently new) safe, performant, binary compiled,
low-level systems programming language.  According to the website, "Myrddin
emphasizes control, simplicity, a clear mental model, and predictable,
transparent behavior.  It features strong type checking, generics, type
inference, closures, and traits.  It aims to fit a similar niche as C, but with
fewer bullets in your feet."

Upon first looking at it, I became immediately interested in the look of the
language, which offers some syntactic elegance that seemed somewhat familiar to
me.  It was not until someone else mentioned it resembled Standard ML a bit --
one of my favorite programming languages -- that I realized why its syntax
seemed so familiar.

## Roadmap

This isn't so much of a map as a collection of a toddler's crayon scribbles on
the living room wall.

* Follow instructional materials on the [Myrddin website][myr]; reformat code
  samples in my own particular idiom for mental-muscle memory, and run them.
  This stuff goes in the `myrsite` directory for now.  In addition to the
  examples on the homepage, see also the [tutorial][myrtut] page.

* Write toy programs of my own devising for exploratory practice.  This stuff
  goes in the `adhockery` directory for now.

* Maybe write Myrddin versions of programs I've written in other languages for
  further practice.  I should try to remember to mention where I'll stash that
  once I have something to stash.
